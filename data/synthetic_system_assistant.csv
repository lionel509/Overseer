How do I check my CPU usage?,"You can check CPU usage using several methods:
1. Use 'top' command for real-time monitoring
2. Use 'htop' for a more user-friendly interface
3. Use 'ps aux' to see process-specific usage
4. Use 'vmstat' for system statistics",system_monitoring
"My system is running slow, what should I check?","When your system is slow, check these areas:
1. CPU usage with 'top' or 'htop'
2. Memory usage with 'free -h'
3. Disk space with 'df -h'
4. Disk I/O with 'iotop'
5. Network usage with 'nethogs'
6. Running processes with 'ps aux'",system_monitoring
How do I find large files on my system?,"To find large files, use these commands:
1. 'find / -type f -size +100M' - files larger than 100MB
2. 'du -sh /*' - directory sizes
3. 'ncdu' - interactive disk usage analyzer
4. 'find / -type f -exec ls -la {} + | sort -k5 -nr | head -20' - top 20 largest files",file_management
What's the best way to monitor system performance?,"For comprehensive system monitoring:
1. Use 'htop' for real-time process monitoring
2. Use 'iotop' for disk I/O monitoring
3. Use 'netstat' or 'ss' for network connections
4. Use 'vmstat' for virtual memory statistics
5. Set up continuous monitoring with tools like 'sar' or 'dstat'
6. Consider system monitoring tools like Nagios or Zabbix for advanced monitoring",system_monitoring
How do I organize my files better?,"Here are effective file organization strategies:
1. Create a clear folder structure
2. Use descriptive names for files and folders
3. Implement a consistent naming convention

6. Use tools like 'find' to locate files quickly",file_management
How can I find duplicate files?,"To find duplicate files:
1. Use 'fdupes' command: 'fdupes -r /path/to/directory'
2. Use 'rdfind' for advanced deduplication
3. Use Python script with hashlib for custom solutions
4. GUI tools like 'dupeGuru' for visual interface
5. Use 'find' with MD5 checksums for manual checking",file_management
How do I clean up disk space?,"To clean up disk space:
1. Remove temporary files: 'sudo rm -rf /tmp/*'
2. Clean package cache: 'sudo apt-get clean' (Ubuntu/Debian)
3. Remove old logs: 'sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d'
4. Find large files: 'find / -type f -size +100M'
5. Use disk cleanup tools like 'bleachbit'
6. Remove old kernels and unused packages",system_maintenance
What should I do if my system won't boot?,"For boot issues, try these steps:
1. Check hardware connections and power
2. Boot from recovery mode or live USB
3. Check disk health with 'fsck'
4. Review boot logs: 'journalctl -b'
5. Check GRUB configuration
6. Restore from backup if available
7. Consider reinstalling bootloader",troubleshooting
How do I secure my system better?,"To improve system security:
1. Keep system updated: 'sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade'
2. Use strong passwords and 2FA
3. Configure firewall: 'ufw enable'
4. Disable unnecessary services
5. Use SSH keys instead of passwords
6. Regular security audits with tools like 'lynis'
7. Monitor system logs for suspicious activity",security
How can I automate system backups?,"To automate backups:
1. Use 'rsync' for file synchronization
2. Set up cron jobs for scheduled backups
3. Use tools like 'duplicity' for encrypted backups
