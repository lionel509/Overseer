# Overseer CLI Demo

This directory contains a self-running demo of the Overseer CLI.

## How to Run the Demo

To run the demo, simply execute the `run_demo.sh` script from the root of the project:

```bash
bash demo/run_demo.sh
```

This will:

1.  **Start Recording:** The `script` command will start recording the terminal session.
2.  **Run the Demo:** The `demo_script.py` will be executed, which will print a step-by-step walkthrough of the Overseer CLI's features.
3.  **Save the Recording:** The recording will be saved to `demo/output/demo_session.log`.

You can then view the recording to see the full demo.
