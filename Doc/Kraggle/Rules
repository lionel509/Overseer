## Description

Hello World! The future of AI is personal, private, and compact enough to run in the palm of your hand. With the launch of Gemma 3n, we are putting the next generation of on-device, multimodal AI into your hands. Now, we challenge you to use this groundbreaking technology to build products that create meaningful, positive change in the world.

This is your opportunity to tackle real-world problems in areas like accessibility, education, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and crisis response. With a total prize pool of $150,000, we're looking for projects that aren't just technically brilliant, but are truly built for impact.

Gemma 3n is Google's first open model built on a new, cutting-edge architecture designed for mobile-first AI. It allows for highly capable, real-time AI to operate directly on phones, tablets, and laptops, enabling experiences that are both personal and private.

## What is Gemma 3n?

Here’s what makes Gemma 3n a game-changer for developers:

- **Optimized On-Device Performance**: Gemma 3n is engineered for speed and efficiency. Thanks to innovations like Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE), the 5B and 8B parameter models run with a memory footprint comparable to 2B and 4B models, making them perfect for resource-constrained devices.
Many-in-1 Flexibility: A single 4B model natively includes a 2B submodel, allowing you to dynamically trade off performance and quality on the fly. You can even use the "mix’n’match" capability to create custom-sized submodels for your specific use case.
- **Privacy-First & Offline Ready**: By running locally, Gemma 3n enables applications that protect user privacy and function reliably, even without an internet connection—a critical feature for accessibility and use in remote areas.
- **Expanded Multimodal Understanding**: Gemma 3n understands and processes interleaved audio, text, and images, with significantly enhanced video understanding. This unlocks powerful capabilities like real-time transcription, translation, and rich, voice-driven interactions.
- **Improved Multilingual Capabilities**: The model features strong performance across multiple languages, including Japanese, German, Korean, Spanish, and French, breaking down communication barriers.

## The Challenge: Your Mission to Build for Impact

Your mission is to leverage the unique capabilities of Gemma 3n to create a product that addresses a significant real-world challenge. Think bigger than a simple chatbot. How can a private, offline-first, multimodal model make a tangible difference in people's lives?

Consider products that:

- **Enhance Accessibility**: Build tools for real-time translation or transcription for the hearing-impaired, or visual description apps for the blind.
- **Revolutionize Education**: Create interactive, offline-ready learning experiences for students in low-connectivity regions.
- **Improve Health & Wellness**: Develop on-device apps that can provide mental health support through voice analysis or act as a personal wellness coach.
- **Promote Environmental Sustainability**: Design an app that uses image and audio recognition to identify local plant diseases, track biodiversity, or promote recycling.
- **Aid in Crisis Response**: Build tools that can operate offline to provide critical information or facilitate communication during natural disasters.

## Evaluation

Your project will be judged primarily on your video demo. This is your chance to create something exciting, compelling, and with the potential to be seen by millions. We want to see the "wow" factor. Your video should tell a story, demonstrate the real-world impact of your product, and leave the judges inspired.

While the video is the star of the show, all projects must be backed by real, functional technology. The accompanying writeup and code repository will be used by our judges to verify that your product is not just a concept but a working proof-of-concept built on Gemma 3n.

### Submission Requirements

You will submit a Writeup to one of the hackathon’s tracks which should minimally include:

The Video Demo (3 minutes or less): This is the most important part of your submission. Create a dynamic, engaging, and high-quality video that demonstrates your project in action.
Your Goal: Tell a story. Show us the problem and how your Gemma 3n app solves it in a powerful way.
Format: You can post your video to YouTube, X (Twitter), TikTok, or any other public platform. You will provide a direct link to the video. It must be viewable by the judges without requiring a login.
The Technical Writeup (The Proof of Work): This paper- or blog-style report is your technical verification. It must clearly explain the architecture of your app, how you specifically used Gemma 3n, the challenges you overcame, and why your technical choices were the right ones. Its primary purpose is to prove to the judges that your video demo is backed by real engineering.
Public Code Repository (The "Source of Truth"): Provide a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, Kaggle Notebook). The code must be well-documented and clearly show the implementation of Gemma 3n. This is non-negotiable and will be used to validate the authenticity of your project.
Public Project Link (The Live Demo): A URL to your working product or interactive demo. This allows judges to experience your project firsthand, if applicable. It should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall.
### Judging Criteria

Your video demo will be the primary lens through which judges evaluate your project, with your writeup and code serving as verification and providing technical depth. Submissions will be scored based on the following criteria:

- **Impact & Vision (40 points)**: As demonstrated in your video, how clearly and compellingly does your project address a significant real-world problem? Is the vision inspiring and does the solution have a tangible potential for positive change?
- **Video Pitch & Storytelling (30 points)**: How exciting, engaging, and well-produced is the video? Does it tell a powerful story that captures the viewer's imagination? Does it clearly and effectively demonstrate the product in action, showcasing a great user experience? Does it have viral potential?
- **Technical Depth & Execution (30 points)**: As verified by the code repository and writeup, how innovative is the use of Gemma 3n's unique features (on-device performance, multimodality, mix'n'match, etc.)? Is the technology real, functional, well-engineered, and not just faked for the demo?

For the Special Technology Prizes, these same criteria will be applied with a focus on how that specific technology (LeRobot, Jetson, Ollama, Unsloth, Google AI Edge) was pivotal in achieving the project's impact and technical excellence.
