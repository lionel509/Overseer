ai_config = {
    'model_type': 'gemma3n',  # or 'custom', 'hybrid'
    'sequence_length': 1024,
    'batch_size': 4,
    'learning_rate': 5e-5,
    'gradient_accumulation': 16,

## üöÄ AI Performance Optimization

### Memory Issues
If you encounter AI memory issues:
1. Try `--cpu-only` mode for minimal memory usage
2. Reduce the AI model size in `training_config.py`
3. Close other applications to free up memory
4. Consider using a smaller base AI model

### Performance Issues
- Mac mode is optimized for Apple Silicon but may be slower than GPU training
- CPU-only mode is significantly slower but uses minimal memory
- Resource-efficient mode provides a balance between speed and memory usage
